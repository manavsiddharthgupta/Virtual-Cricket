# Virtual-Cricket
This is Virtual Cricket Game. With women and girls still less likely to be take part in sport than their male counterparts, itâ€™s now more important than ever to encourage them to get involved from an early age. Therefore we try to create this small virtual cricket game so that girls play this game and attract towards real physical games.
